# SudokuSolver

Hi, thanks for checking out my sudoku solver!
  This was the first project I ever attempted(so excuse my complete lack of any proper coding fundamentals)!
  I learned alot however,(mostly how not to approach complex problems!) and am excited to go back 
  and refactor the project into more maintainable(and readable) code....
